		<h2>Websites don't have to be complicated</h2>
		<p>I'm not the first to notice, websites are getting rather complicated.</p>
		<p>Everyday browsers are frightened by the jargon and sheer amount if choice there is when it comes to building a website.</p>
		<p>Back to basics websites - built with pure untainted HTML5 with no classes or styles. With limits, comes creativity.</p>
		<p>Take a look at the source - really - it's not hard. Just right click, view source (usually). I'll bet you can understand my code, and write it yourself. <b>Why not?</b></p>
